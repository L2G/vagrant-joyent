    states:
      long_not_created: The Joyent instance is not created. Run `vagrant up` to create it.
      long_provisioning: |-
        The Joyent instance is still being created. Vagrant normally waits until the
        instance has been created before working with it, so it could have been
        interrupted prematurely during `vagrant up`. Please wait a few minutes and
        try again. You may need to run `vagrant provision` once the instance is
        running.
      long_running: |-
        The Joyent instance is running. To stop this machine, you can run
        `vagrant halt`. To destroy the machine, you can run `vagrant destroy`.
      long_stopped: |-
        The Joyent instance is stopped but still accruing charges on your account.
        This is not a state that this plugin can handle at present. You should
        either run `vagrant destroy` to delete it and stop charges, or restart it
        yourself via the Joyent UI.
      short_deleted: deleted
      short_failed: failed

      was declined.
